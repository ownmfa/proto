# OwnMFA Proto

This repository contains the
[Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) and
[gRPC](https://grpc.io/) definitions for the
[OwnMFA](https://www.ownmfa.com/) Hermes platform. API design is based
on the Google [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design).

## Getting Started

The PHP package can be copied locally from this repository or regenerated
using the Protobuf definitions. See the
[gRPC PHP quick start](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/php/quickstart/) for
more information.
